        summary:
          "A Texas project led by Return Carbon, Skytree, and EDF aims to build the world's first direct air capture (DAC) facility powered primarily by on-site wind energy. Slated for 2028, the plant will remove up to 500,000 metric tons of CO2 annually, storing it underground. The innovative agreement ensures low-cost clean energy supply while allowing EDF to redirect excess electricity to the grid during peak pricing. DAC technology, though expensive, is crucial for combating climate change by removing atmospheric CO2. European firms are targeting Texas for its abundant wind resources and favorable geology for carbon storage.",

DAC removes CO₂ directly from the atmosphere, supporting LFC’s goals to halve operational emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2040. The partnership includes offsetting product emissions through DAC-based carbon credits. DAC is recognized by the International Energy Agency as vital for achieving net zero, with large-scale projects like STRATOS in Texas underway. The initiative aligns with broader football and global sustainability efforts, including the European Club Association’s climate strategies.",

          "Climate change is primarily driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels for energy, transport, and industry, which release greenhouse gases like CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. Additional contributors include deforestation, farming, overfishing, and industrial processes. These activities destabilize the climate, causing extreme weather, rising sea levels, and ecosystem disruptions. The MENA region, with significant fossil fuel production, now has high per capita CO2 emissions. Urgent action is needed to curb emissions and prevent irreversible tipping points, such as polar ice sheet collapse, permafrost melt, and Amazon rainforest degradation.",
