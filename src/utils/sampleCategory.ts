        summary:
          "Northern Lights, a joint venture by TotalEnergies, Equinor, and Shell, is the world's first large-scale CO2 transport and storage project. Operational from September 2024, it stores 1.5 million tons of CO2 annually in geological layers 2,600 meters beneath the Norwegian North Sea. Approved by Norway in 2020 and designated a Project of Common Interest by the EU, it aims to decarbonize European heavy industry. A commercial agreement with Yara will sequester 800,000 tons of CO2 annually from its Netherlands plant. Future expansions could increase capacity to 5 million tons per year, supporting TotalEnergies' goal of 10 million tons by 2030.",

        summary:
          "Researchers at Beijing Institute of Technology developed the C3IAM/GCOP tool to optimize global carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) deployment, identifying cost-effective source-sink pairings and proposing strategies to meet Paris Agreement targets. Their analysis mapped industrial CO₂ sources and storage sites globally, suggesting CCUS could reduce emissions by 92 gigatonnes by 2050 at a cost of 0.12% of global GDP. In China, achieving carbon neutrality requires constructing 17,000 km of pipelines and prioritizing five key regions. Despite its potential, CCUS adoption faces challenges, necessitating interdisciplinary collaboration and infrastructure development to scale implementation effectively.",
