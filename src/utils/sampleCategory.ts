While countries like Norway and the U.K. are advancing large-scale CCS projects, skepticism persists about its economic and environmental viability. Norway's Northern Lights project and the U.K.'s Longship initiative highlight progress, but concerns remain about the financial burden on consumers and the unproven nature of the technology. Critics argue funds could be better allocated to renewable energy. Despite this, CCS is projected to grow at a 16% CAGR through 2031, driven by advancements in direct air capture and carbon utilization.",

Aerobic bacteria increase while methanogens decline, reducing CH4 emissions but increasing CO2 and N2O emissions. Net greenhouse gas emissions rise, driven by CO2. Proximity to drainage ditches intensifies these effects. Soil temperature and water table changes are key drivers of emissions, with seasonal variations playing a role. Structural shifts in microbial and fungal communities further impact carbon and nitrogen cycling. These findings highlight the localized and complex impacts of drainage on peatland ecosystems.",

Appalachia has low leak rates (<1%), while the Permian Basin has high rates (up to 9.6%). Prest estimates methane emissions from oil exports cause $2.5 billion in annual climate damages. Federal control over production is limited, and policies like methane fees aim to reduce emissions. LNG exports modestly increase domestic gas prices while lowering oil prices.",
